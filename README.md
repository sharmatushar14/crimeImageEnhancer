# Cyber Forensics: Enhancing Unclear Images Received as Crime with Reference to Underwater Image Enhancement

This project focuses on utilizing cyber forensics techniques to enhance unclear images received as evidence of crimes, with a particular focus on underwater image enhancement. This enhancement is achieved through the implementation of various algorithms and techniques to address challenges such as poor visibility, low light levels, color distortion, and image blur caused by water movement.

## Overview

Underwater image enhancement programs are specifically designed to tackle the unique challenges encountered when capturing images in an underwater environment. These challenges not only include poor visibility and low light levels but also extend to issues like color distortion and image blur. By applying sophisticated algorithms and techniques, these challenges can be effectively mitigated, resulting in clearer and more informative images.

## Algorithms Used

### Grey World Algorithm

The Grey World Algorithm is a color constancy algorithm that aims to remove color casts from images by adjusting the white balance. This algorithm is particularly effective in addressing color distortion issues commonly encountered in underwater images.

## Implementation Details

The project leverages the following technologies and libraries:

- **Pillow**: Pillow is a Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork, which provides support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. It is used for image processing tasks such as loading images, applying filters, and saving enhanced images.

- **NumPy**: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. It is utilized for efficient handling and manipulation of image data.

- **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is employed for visualizing the results of image enhancement processes.

## Project Scope

The techniques and algorithms employed in underwater image enhancement have broader applicability beyond just underwater imagery. They can also be effectively utilized to enhance other types of images suffering from similar problems, such as low contrast, poor lighting, and color distortion.

## Acknowledgments

This project was undertaken by Tushar Sharma as an Intern under the National Technical Research & Development Committee, National Police Mission, under the guidance of Sh. Maithili Sharan Gupt (Presidents, Crime Free Bharat && Former DGP of Bhopal, MP, Police Reforms). It was part of the initiative towards achieving a crime-free Bharat (India), led by MSG's Crime Free Bharat movement.

## Note

This project is aimed at contributing to the advancement of cyber forensics capabilities in the context of crime investigation. It serves as a testament to the collaborative efforts between academia, research institutions, and law enforcement agencies in addressing contemporary challenges in digital forensics.
